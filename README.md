Various quality of life (objection.lol)[https://objection.lol/courtroom] courtroom features & tweaks, ranging from tiny UI changes to roleplay testimony UIs.

Note: the extension is still unfinished and in beta - several assets and features are temporarily replaced by placeholders

## Options

Upon installation, the extension has a page of toggleable options with descriptions to personalize your courtroom experience. It can be accessed from the extension icon pop-up. (Option preview images not yet implemented)

## Known Issues

Due to the way the extension loads, sometimes it will not process when a courtroom is opened - in such cases, the courtroom page must be reloaded. (This will be fixed in a nearby patch)
